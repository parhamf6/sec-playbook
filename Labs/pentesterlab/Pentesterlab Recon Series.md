just go to the website and add the robots.txt , it goes something like this :
`https://hackycorp.com/robots.txt`
and we found the key : 
`af9c328a-02b4-439d-91c6-f46ab4a0835b`

# Recon 01 : 
Really?
it just too simple add some thing after the url that you know is BS. something like this :
`https://hackycorp.com/opihrgweopuirgne`
and then you got the key :
`aeaee57f-2a82-41da-bc4c-d081c8cddfc8`

Finally, some thing cool. for this level you should first see the refrences to learn what is the `security.txt` so when we see in the refrences it say that in most websites if its standard it most be in the address `.well-known/security.txt`, so we go for it:
`https://hackycorp.com/.well-known/security.txt`
and then we got the key for next level :
`99685e30-7061-4ac0-83bf-4ccc0409faac`

# Recon 03 : 
kind of tricky. first try was to try and go to the assets but there was not support any directory listing , for example if we visit this :
`https://assets.hackycorp.com/img`
we get access denied, so we should try to get other directory. after reading the code we see that there use this for there logo : 
`images/logo.png`
so we tried this :
`https://hackycorp.com/images/`
we get a directory and there we have a file names `key.txt` so when we visit that we get the key for next level : 
`93790afa-6985-47fd-b564-aa7ba59ed6a9`

# Recon 04 :

# Recon 05 :
for this level we use some fuzzing tool. my favorite ffuf. and for the wordlist we visit this [Seclist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
one of the wordlists under the fuzzing is common.txt and we use that, using this ffuf command :
```bash
ffuf -u https://hackycorp.com/FUZZ -w common.txt -mc 200,301,302
```
output of the code :
```bash
.well-known/security.txt [Status: 200, Size: 156, Words: 24, Lines: 4, Duration: 98ms]
admin                   [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 158ms]

```
only directory we did not visit until not is startpage so we go to this url :
`https://hackycorp.com/startpage/`
and we get this key :
`498621b0-17fe-4ebb-8324-3de7743fea51`

# Recon 06 : 
in web servers can have multiple websites in them. a web server has only one IP then in that we server we can set multiple websites and how the web server open the right website for us? using header. if we send a request directly to the ip of the web server without any header web server show us the default page that we can call vhost too. for this first we need to find the IP address. we use this command : 
```bash
dig hackycorp.com
```
then we get the IP :
`51.158.147.132`
and when we send a request to it : 
```bash
curl http://51.158.147.132
```
we get this output : 
```text
<h1>Well done! You solved recon_06 </h1>

The key for this exercise is 5cf83b5d-eb6c-4eee-af6c-945f9aed8dfd
```
so the key is :
`5cf83b5d-eb6c-4eee-af6c-945f9aed8dfd`
we could just visit the http://51.158.147.132 in our browser, its the same thing.

# Recon 07 : 
like the past level but this time We bypass TLS certificate validation to reach the default TLS virtual host.`-k` lets you bypass TLS certificate checks, and a fake `Host` header forces the web server to fall back to its default virtual host after TLS is established.Because the certificate presented by the default vhost does not match the IP address, curl would normally abort the connection unless `-k` is used.
so for this we use this command :
```bash
curl -k https://51.158.147.132 -H "Host: random"
```
and output : 
```text
<h1>Well done! You solved recon_07</h1>

The key for this exercise is 23eafa56-6d55-4b78-8307-24e7dc2ce5e6

# Recon 08 : 
for this level first we need to find the certificate then encode and find all the alt names and then try to connect to one of those alt names. lets go.
first we can find SSL using openssl but we need to decode it too so we use this command :
```bash
openssl s_client -connect hackycorp.com:443 -servername hackycorp.com \
  | openssl x509 -noout -ext subjectAltName
```
- `openssl s_client` fetches the certificate
    
- `openssl x509 -text` decodes it
    
- `-noout` hides raw PEM output
then we have this output : 
```text
depth=2 C = US, O = Internet Security Research Group, CN = ISRG Root X1
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R13
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = hackycorp.com
verify return:1
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
    DNS:66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com, DNS:hackycorp.com, DNS:www.hackycorp.com
```
this URL looks interesting `66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com` so we send a request to it : 
```bash
curl https://66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com
```
we get this output : 
```text
<h1>Well done! You solved   recon_08</h1>

The key for this exercise is: 1763ec4f-8467-47f7-9a80-6de93a1a2253

This level is easy. objective is very clear we should check the header.
so we use this curl command : 
```bash
curl -I https://hackycorp.com
```
- -I is mean we send a HEAD request, with this we only get the header, what we want.
the output is this :
```text

this one is kind of tricky, it says that in subdomain that gives us has the key in color red.
it suggest a tool that they dont work really. beucase of that i had this idea to write a python code that go to every subdomain and donwload the logo.png , they put the key on that and after check the downloaded logoes we could find our key. this is our code :
```python
import requests
from pathlib import Path

# Generate hosts
hosts = [f"0x{i:02x}.a.hackycorp.com" for i in range(256)]

output_dir = Path("logos")
output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

for host in hosts:
    url = f"http://{host}/logo.png"
    try:
        r = requests.get(
            url,
            timeout=5,
            verify=False,
            proxies={"http": "", "https": ""}
        )
        print(f"{host} -> {r.status_code} {r.headers.get('Content-Type')}")
        if r.status_code == 200 and "image" in (r.headers.get("Content-Type") or ""):
            file_path = output_dir / f"{host}.png"
            file_path.write_bytes(r.content)
            print(f"[+] Saved {file_path}")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"[!] {host} failed: {e}")
```
so when we find the red images we can extract the key : 
`483f8b15-e4a8-4387-b052-4b2204c7eb69`
