Open redirect usually lets us move users to an external link, but here it is used in a different way.

The `stockApi` parameter is restricted and only allows **internal URLs**, like paths that start with `/product/...`. Because of this restriction, we cannot directly point `stockApi` to something like `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`.

While testing the application, we notice that the **next product** functionality has an open redirect. The `path` parameter is reflected directly into the `Location` header, which means the application will redirect to whatever URL we provide.

This is important because the open redirect endpoint itself is **internal** (`/product/nextProduct`), so it is allowed by the stock checker. When the stock checker calls this internal endpoint, the server follows the redirect and ends up requesting the **admin interface**.

So instead of giving `stockApi` a direct external URL, we give it an internal URL that redirects externally.

Final payload used in `stockApi`:

`/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
